## Project Overview

## Business Problem

Bellabeat aims to better understand how users engage with its fitness tracking features in order to support healthier daily habits and improve long-term product engagement.

This analysis focuses on identifying key patterns in user behavior by examining:
- The average number of daily steps per user
- How consistently users record activity data over time
- Average daily calorie expenditure across users
- How user activity time is distributed across sedentary, lightly active, and very active minutes
- The relationship between daily steps and calories burned

By analyzing these behavioral patterns, Bellabeat can identify opportunities to encourage increased movement, reduce sedentary behavior, and design more personalized engagement strategies.

## Tools Used
- SQL (Google BigQuery)
- Google Sheets (intermediate analysis)
- Tableau Public (data visualization)
- GitHub (project documentation)

---

## Key Analysis Questions
1. What is the average daily step count per user?
2. How frequently do users log activity data?
3. How does activity intensity differ across users?
4. What is the relationship between daily steps and calories burned?

---

## Key Insights
- High-activity users take far more daily steps than other groups
- Sedentary minutes dominate daily activity, highlighting an opportunity for habit-building features and movement-focused nudges
- Calories burned differ widely at similar step counts, suggesting users differ in efficiency and intensity
- Engagement drops for a subset of users, suggesting the need for personalized reminders and retention strategies for a core group of highly-engaged users

---

## Recommendations
- Encourage consistent daily logging through reminders
- Target low-activity users with achievable step goals
- Promote features that reduce sedentary behavior rather than only increasing steps
- Use personalized reminders tailored to individual activity intensity and movement patterns.
